# Data-Warehouse-creation-and-visualization-in-Power-BI

We assume that we are an insurance startup located in Chicago with plans of expanding our products to 
life & wealth insurance packages. In order for the pricing, risk and budget to be properly calculated, it is 
necessary to study not only crime rates but any economic factor that may influence them significantly. 
Therefore, we attempt to combine, analyze and visualize two datasets taken directly from Chicago Data 
Portal. After cleaning the datasets, we use traditional ETL procedures to create a database holding all 
useful information, then create a cube with OLAP services which we use in Power BI to extract our conclusions 
regarding which factors should be taken into account on our future products and deals, especially 
when screening new customers for custom offers. Some of these factors include counts for specific crime 
categories, crime coordinates in association with the community area that they indicate, economic 
measures for said community areas and the overall crime rates during the years 2008-2012.
